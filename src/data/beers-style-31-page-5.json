From being castigated by our West Marin neighbors to finally suffering an 'eviction' by our West Marin septic system. From landing in the welcoming arms of Petaluma, and actually getting our beer into bottles, onto the streets, and into the hands of sympathatic beer geeks, to steadily losing less money each month. From all this and more, Lagunitas Brewing Company is emerging as a battle-tested brewery capable of making great beer out of goat's milk, brambles, and asphalt on the surface of the Moon, if need be.\r\n\r\nAs the poet once said, 'Where, but for the grace of God and the kindness of strangers, go I'.

Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:15","locations":[{"id":"wbpj5b","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1675 N Western Ave","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60647","phone":"773-725-9428","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.912447,"longitude":-87.686905,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rdaqVf","name":"Blatant Double IPA","nameDisplay":"Blatant Double IPA","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/rdaqVf\/upload_1nOokQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/rdaqVf\/upload_1nOokQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/rdaqVf\/upload_1nOokQ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 22:45:15","updateDate":"2015-12-17 11:47:58","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
