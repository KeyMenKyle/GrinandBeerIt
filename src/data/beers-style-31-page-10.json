Owner\/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.","website":"http:\/\/www.rushriverbeer.com","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:30","locations":[{"id":"hHD54O","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"990 Antler Court","locality":"River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54022","phone":"1-715-426-2054","latitude":44.8902357,"longitude":-92.6377675,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qfSBdt","name":"Double Cannon","nameDisplay":"Double Cannon","description":"Hop aromas blast out of this flavor explosion.

Some beers may be bottled further down the line but for now it's all draft. The only way you can take our beer away is in the form of a growler - which by the way, is a great way to drink beer! \r\n\r\nLook for a focus of plenty of hoppy beers, belgian-style saisons, dark beers, and sour beers. We are huge fans of wine and bourbon barrel aged beers as well so it's only natural for us to have a barrel program. Think bourbon barrels loaded with big chewy imperial stouts, excessively hopped IPAs, fruited sour beers, and funky saisons. This is what we love. This is what we are all about. We hope you are too!\r\n\r\nPlease follow along for the ride as we build San Francisco's next great brewery.\r\n\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/www.cellarmakerbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-24 20:56:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:51:35","locations":[{"id":"2MDtOB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1150 Howard Street","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94103","phone":"(415) 863-3940","website":"http:\/\/www.cellarmakerbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nFri:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  1:00pm - 8:00pm","latitude":37.777218,"longitude":-122.410768,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-24 21:02:33","updateDate":"2015-08-06 20:11:31","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eO2mZN","name":"Double Dog Dare IPA","nameDisplay":"Double Dog Dare IPA","abv":"11.5","availableId":4,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-06-10 20:16:19","updateDate":"2012-06-10 23:14:57","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
