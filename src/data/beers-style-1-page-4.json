Earthy on the nose with a light floral background, this brew has a lingering caramel malt flavor and a splash of fresh citrus. The chosen yeast strain provides a distinctly European feel, but our hop profile remains uniquely American in delivering the expected flavor and aroma, as well as a characteristic bitter edge. It is hop-forward with a balance towards late hop additions and bitterness, yet this medium-bodied brew maintains an ample malt foundation on the way to a smooth, refreshing finish.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"36","glasswareId":5,"styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/58gT1s\/upload_rOdxvg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/58gT1s\/upload_rOdxvg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/58gT1s\/upload_rOdxvg-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pale ales are great beers to pair with a wide variety of foods.
