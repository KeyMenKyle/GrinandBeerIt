Previously known as the \u201cBib Corner\u201d, this location has an interesting historical past. Originally designed for the Peninsula restaurant, this three story structure was built by Nicholas Bauman in 1874.\r\n\r\nThis elegant restaurant gave way to the Franklin and Folz clothing store from 1884 to 1924. Through the years, the building housed a succession of businesses, including the Kalamazoo Stove company, a book bindery and a hotel.\r\n\r\nIt became the headquarters for W.R. Biggs\/Gilmore Agency in 1973. Severely damaged by the 1980 tornado, the building was completely rehabilitated in 1980-81.\r\n\r\nThe current owners, Marie and Stephen Blinn, wish to bring back a piece of history for all of Kalamazoo to enjoy. We are proud to offer to you the freshest beer available, brewed on-site in our 7-barrel brew house.","website":"http:\/\/oldepenkazoo.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:53:46","locations":[{"id":"fWfbGJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 East Michigan Avenue","locality":"Kalamazoo","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49007","phone":"1-269-343-2739","website":"http:\/\/oldepenkazoo.com\/","latitude":42.2916515,"longitude":-85.5815665,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"StgNf5","name":"Major Holmes DIPA","nameDisplay":"Major Holmes DIPA","description":"Just like Major Andrew Holmes himself, this Imperial IPA is a little bit of a mystery as we will be utilizing different hops in huge quantities in each version including blends of 5 different hops and experimental varieties as they come available.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-01-15 16:17:52","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ttx9O8","name":"Mama Said Hop You Out","nameDisplay":"Mama Said Hop You Out","description":"Don\u2019t need a hopback \/ Been dry hopping for years \/ Late hopping my beers and putting suckas in fear\r\n Makin the alphas rain down like a MON-soon \/ Smell the aromas go BOOM \/ Explosin, overpowerin \/ Over the competition, I\u2019m towerin \/ I\u2019m gonna hop you out!!! \/ Mama Said hop you out!!!","abv":"8","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-24 22:44:09","updateDate":"2015-04-24 22:44:09","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

During his college days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along to the company's president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves. Since then we have expanded our product line and our distribution territory but continue to brew up a storm in our Middletown Brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.newportstorm.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:44","locations":[{"id":"oz1oll","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"307 Oliphant Lane","locality":"Middletown","region":"Rhode Island","postalCode":"02842","phone":"401-849-5232","website":"http:\/\/www.newportstorm.com\/","latitude":41.5369904,"longitude":-71.2796012,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:18:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6WWAKc","name":"Master Of The Galaxy","nameDisplay":"Master Of The Galaxy","abv":"7.8","ibu":"90","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 15:19:29","updateDate":"2015-06-15 15:54:56","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hjlYL0","name":"Misconduct","nameDisplay":"Misconduct","description":"Sometimes life blows the whistle and encourages you to take a seat for a bit.
