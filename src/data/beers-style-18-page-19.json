Founded in 2015 by Beverly residents Paul and Christen Gentile, we are focused on providing our community with fresh craft beer made with quality ingredients. We believe good beer should be enjoyed and not fussed over. Our beer is made using traditional English-style brewing methods and ingredients. Our product line includes a set of four year-round beers and small batch releases that give us a chance to try out new ideas. Our low ABV year-round beers allow you to enjoy more than one without feeling like you were hit by a truck the next day.\r\n\r\nGentile Brewing Company can be easily found in downtown Beverly, steps from the Beverly Depot MBTA station. The building at 59 Park Street was built in 1884 and originally housed Creesy Shoe Factory, among many other manufacturers over its storied 130 plus year history. Our beers pay homage to those who worked and lived in the Beverly community all of those years ago. We hope you\u2019ll come visit us soon!\r\n\r\nPaul & Christen Gentile","website":"http:\/\/gentilebrewing.com","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@gentilebrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-21 13:03:12","updateDate":"2016-06-08 14:34:59","locations":[{"id":"taYuqM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"59 Park St #1","locality":"Beverly","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01915","phone":"(978) 969-6496","website":"gentilebrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 4:00pm\n\nFri:4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:12:00 pm - 4:00 pm","latitude":42.5493947,"longitude":-70.8843902,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-21 13:03:13","updateDate":"2016-06-08 14:33:29","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RIV5hX","name":"Porter","nameDisplay":"Porter","description":"Rich roasted chocolate malt and smoky flavors are balanced with fresh aromatic hops.

This is the spirit of Slumbrew.\r\n\r\nSlumbrew is the research & development brand and concept of Somerville Brewing Company. Our mission is to brew unique, ingredient-driven beers that challenge common notions of what a beer should taste like. It is the result of nearly 15 years of beer travel and research by Caitlin Jewell and Jeff Leiter; and a decade of Jeff\u2019s homebrewing recipe formulation.\r\n\r\nWe produce a lot of small-run, pilot beers at the Slumbrew Beerlab, but only a small number make their way to commercial production. The Somerville Brewing Company contracts with regional breweries to make the best recipes for wide-spread commercial release, but each recipe is an evolving process of refinement. This model for beer production provides an opportunity to experiment with innovative local ingredients to produce craft beers that stand apart from typical formulations.","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:30:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:13","locations":[{"id":"pATY6L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Ward St.","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02143","phone":"1-800-428-1150","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.3748173,"longitude":-71.0892732,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:36:08","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:45:09","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"KmOr3n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Ward Street","locality":"Somerville","region":"MA","hoursOfOperation":"11am - 12am","latitude":42.3748173,"longitude":-71.0892732,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-04-29 21:38:08","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:45:44","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"dgdVJz","name":"American Fresh Beer Garden","streetAddress":"310 Canal St.","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02145","phone":"1.800.428.1150","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 10:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":42.3941311,"longitude":-71.079673,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-08 13:50:59","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:50:59","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kQ6cJ9","name":"Porter From Hell","nameDisplay":"Porter From Hell","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:59","updateDate":"2015-04-10 19:10:25","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

They first met during graduate school at the University of Minnesota where the fates would have it, they joined the same chemistry research group.  The guys spent many a night proving the adage of their PhD (piled higher & deeper) advisor, \u201cThe true test of running a scientific instrument is being able to operate it after a few beers.\u201d  After graduation, Grant and Phil pursued different career paths, Grant went the academic route, while Phil initially started out in the chemical industry, but then wised up and conned people into hiring him as a beer then wine chemist.  After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that\u2019s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!
