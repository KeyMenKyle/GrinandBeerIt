Pale golden-straw color with a nice 1-finger head and good retention. Aromas are of a strong pine and citrus hop. The pine and citrus flavors both come through with taste that nearly conceals the malt, but not quite. For a hoppy beer, it finishes with easy linger, a medim mouth feel and a very warming afterglow.","abv":"8.5","ibu":"75","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/vVq5hG\/upload_kkq4z2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/vVq5hG\/upload_kkq4z2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/vVq5hG\/upload_kkq4z2-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:27","updateDate":"2015-12-16 09:36:33","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up.

They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham \u2013 Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place\/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South.  The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room.  The building was selected for it\u2019s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles.  To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job.  As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery.  After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go.  The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks.\r\n\r\nCahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating \"Last Pint Night\" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking. The space is also flexible, offering multiple options for all varieties of private event needs such as weddings, reunions, corporate events, and birthday parties.","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:45:16","updateDate":"2016-02-02 17:39:14","locations":[{"id":"hMvwjg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4500 5th Ave South","extendedAddress":"Building C","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35222","phone":"205-578-2616","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","latitude":33.526729,"longitude":-86.764854,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:46:42","updateDate":"2016-02-02 17:43:17","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sO5o7k","name":"Imperial Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Imperial Pale Ale","abv":"10","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-07 16:27:53","updateDate":"2015-03-09 16:42:57","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:14:24","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QC0Nrs","name":"Imperial Topaz","nameDisplay":"Imperial Topaz","description":"While some might celebrate 23 years of joy and happiness with the traditional anniversary gift of an Imperial Topaz gemstone, we chose to honor our faithful fans with an Imperial Topaz IPA.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:23","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"W7qHV2","name":"Java Wicked","nameDisplay":"Java Wicked","description":"American Imperial IPA w\/ coffee.","abv":"8.4","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-03 16:06:55","updateDate":"2015-02-03 16:06:55","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:40","locations":[{"id":"MfINpl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Ottley Drive","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30324","phone":"404-691-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","latitude":33.808102,"longitude":-84.38119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VXbEB4","name":"Johnson","nameDisplay":"Johnson","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/VXbEB4\/upload_Bra1GR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/VXbEB4\/upload_Bra1GR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/VXbEB4\/upload_Bra1GR-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-12 12:58:29","updateDate":"2015-12-17 09:58:46","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
