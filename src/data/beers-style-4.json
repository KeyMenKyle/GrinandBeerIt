It is quite possible that when Robert Theakston founded the brewery in 1827 the range of ales would have been limited to just two or three of which almost certainly, one would have been a bitter beer. Consequently it would be reasonable to argue that Theakston Best Bitter is one of the longest established session ales in Yorkshire.\r\nWhen we refer to a \u2018bitter\u2019 beer, the term does not mean sour as in lemons, but dry as in \u2018dry white wine\u2019. So Best Bitter is a full bodied, dry beer.\r\nWe use five different hop varieties to make our Best Bitter forming a complex but subtle taste profile. The combination of dryness as generated through the use of Target and Challenger hops, is balanced by sweetness created by the generous use of prime malting Barley providing the perfect accompaniment to a wide variety of food flavours as found in a Ploughman\u2019s lunch for instance.","abv":"3.8","styleId":4,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 01:33:32","updateDate":"2012-08-02 01:33:32","style":{"id":4,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Special Bitter or Best Bitter","shortName":"Special Bitter","description":"Special bitter is more robust than ordinary bitter.
