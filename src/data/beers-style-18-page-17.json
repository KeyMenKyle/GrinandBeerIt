We brew our European Style beer in accordance with the Bavarian Brewing Tradition of \u201cReinheitsgebot\u201d, the German beer purity law of 1516. This means that nothing is added to the beer except yeast, hops, water and grain. All of our Bavarian Style Beer contains malt and hops from Germany. Our Brew masters have extensively traveled Germany and the Czech Republic and have visited many breweries to learn the art of old world style brewing.","website":"http:\/\/luminawine.com\/our-brewery\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:14:56","locations":[{"id":"jrzfqS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"311 Judges Road","extendedAddress":"Unit 8A","locality":"Wilmington","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28405","phone":"910-793-5299","website":"http:\/\/luminawine.com\/our-brewery\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesday-Saturday: 11:00AM-6:00PM\r\nClosed on Sunday & Monday","latitude":34.253835,"longitude":-77.856525,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","yearClosed":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8j1nFE","name":"Porcupine Porter","nameDisplay":"Porcupine Porter","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:59","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:47","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.
